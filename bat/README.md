# Bat: a cat clone with wings

[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) is cat(1) clone with syntax highlighting and git integration.

It's absolutely incredible. except typing cat has already become permanent muscle memory.

```bash
alias cat='bat'
```

The configuration is fairly simple:

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
stow bat
```
